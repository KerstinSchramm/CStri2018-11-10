Explanation to 5.1. and 5.2.:
5.1.Switch of country/language 
	At the moment there are 22 countries listed in this selection box. Possibly there can be hundreds more entries. 
    To verify that after a changement each selected entry still opens the correct website, an automated test simplifies 
	the testing a lot. Whereas the addition of new test steps should be a manageable work.

	At the moment there are 4 themes listed but there could be many themes more. 
	To verify that after a changement each selected theme still opens the correct topic, an automated test simplifies
